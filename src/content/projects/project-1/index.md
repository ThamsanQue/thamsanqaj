I created this passion project to support entrepreneurial-minded individuals looking to kickstart their e-commerce journeys easily and at no cost. It serves as a sandbox where users can experiment, learn, and pivot quickly without the financial burden of platforms like Shopify. Additionally, itâ€™s designed for other developers to clone or fork, offering them an advanced e-commerce starter pack for building client projects efficiently.
