TrustMarkt was born out of my personal experience of being scammed on Facebook Marketplace while trying to buy a second-hand Xbox controller. That incident highlighted the lack of regulation in social commerce, where faceless accounts are used to scam people with no accountability. I decided to create TrustMarkt to help buyers verify sellers and allow sellers to authenticate themselves. The platform uses facial recognition and neural network algorithms to capture and create a unique "Trust Mark" based on the sellerâ€™s facial landmarks. It also registers the seller's address via GPS, locks the device's IP, and creates a platform account with links to their social profiles. This allows buyers to confidently search for sellers and verify their identity before engaging in a transaction, provided the seller displays their TrustMark on their page.
