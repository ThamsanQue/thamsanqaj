_Prequel to Artopia_ is a groundbreaking virtual fashion show created entirely in Blender, showcasing the potential of a fully CG fashion event that rivals traditional shows in impact. This marks the beginning of **Artopia**, a fusion of art and utopia, where creativity is limitless. Artopia is the vision behind **Cr8-xyz**, the platform I'm building to empower artists, creators and brands to dream freely and bring their ideas to life in a fully immersive, digital world. Powered by Blender, this show is just the first of many that will shape the future of digital artistry and fashion within Artopia's vibrant universe.
